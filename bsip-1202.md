# Abstract

Confidential Transactions/Assets (CT or CA) solve the linkability and value-hiding problems, but not the traceability problem.  CT transfers are traceable on the blockchain, meaning that for any given output, a history of prior inputs can be determined.  If the set of prior inputs is large, then there is a great degree of plausible-deniability regarding the origins of the hidden assets.  However, if the set is small, it is possible to determine with increasing probability where the assets originated from.  A solution to this is to “mix” inputs with unrelated users so as to increase the traceability set.  Some privacy blockchains rely on a mechanical mixing or “tumbling” process to increase the traceability set, however this approach has drawbacks.  Monero has a very clever scheme of using ring signatures to automatically and randomly mix in unrelated inputs on every transaction, guaranteeing that even newly blinded funds are mixed with with inputs having a rich history.  It is proposed to implement a similar mechanism for BitShares
