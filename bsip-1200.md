# Abstract

To discuss the continued development of Stealth functionality and provide an overview of the following six BSIPs which define components of that development.
  
# Motivation

Confidential functionality on the BitShares network thus far consists only in the implementation of Confidential Transactions (CT), as defined in a paper by Greg Maxwell (cite).  CT allows for *value-blinding*, or the hiding of the value amounts of transactions.  Through the use of blind signatures and stealth addresses, CT also privides partial *unlinkability*, or the inability to "link" balance elements (we'll call them UTXOs for Unspent Transaction Outputs) together and see that they are controlled by the same party. However, wallet implementations may, in order to facilitate discovery by the receiving party, publicly embed the stealth address of the receiving party into the transaction, thus breaking unlinkability.  Heretofore, no privacy-preserving method has been proposed on this network to enable discovery, other than the sender and receiver being in direct communication off of the blockchain (e.g. sending *transaction receipts*).  Furthermore, CT transactions are *traceable*, meaning that a transaction reveals which UTXOs are consumed in the creation of new UTXOs.  This has two implications: (1) a transaction history can be constructed, and it may be possible to establish a vary narrow set of originating users who initally "blinded" a previously public balance, and thus potentially establishing to a high degree of probability *who* is involved and *how much* value is involved in a particular sequence of transactions, and (2) a user spending a balance consisting of more than one UTXO will of necessity reveal that those UTXOs are controlled by the same party, or "linked," thus again breaking unlinkability.
  
In what follows we propose methods of enhancing the confidential abilities offered by the BitShares network by integrating specific solutions to achieve unlinkability, untraceability, and automated transaction discovery by the receiving party.  Additionally, since BitShares is a multi-asset blockchain, we propse to adopt Confidential Assets (CA).  CA is an extension to CT that hides not just the values of a transaction, but also the assets involved.  Further, we propose various convenience and user-experience enhancements to ease the backup burden placed on users and reduce the chances of lost funds.  Lastly, we propose an ongoing effort to harden wallets and p2p nodes against metadata leaks.
