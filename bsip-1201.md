## Abstract

Confidential Assets (CA) extends Confidential Transactions (CT) to include asset hiding.  The BitShares network already understands and validates CT transactions, but is not yet capable of validating CA transactions.  The transaction format will need minor to moderate updating and the validation routines will likewise need updating. We propose to either (a) update op-code 39, 49, and 41 to be CA capable, or (b) define new opcodes for CA stealth operations.  The latter option probably affords a cleaner upgrade path.  The old opcodes should then be disfavored for user wallet use.
